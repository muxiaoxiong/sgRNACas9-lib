# Background
CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing tool. The design and off-target evaluation of sgRNA for the whole genome is a time-consuming process. Based on the optimization of the new algorithm, this software can greatly reduce the time for off-target evaluation.

sgRNAcas9-lib has been tested on the platforms below:

- GNU/Linux (Ubuntu)
# Requirement
- python >=3.5
- gcc

# Download
```
git clone https://github.com/muxiaoxiong/sgRNACas9-lib.git
```
# Usage
```
python3 sgRNAcas9_lib.py
```
# File description
bin --->It was used to evaluate sgRNA off-target condition
